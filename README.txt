shine is a minimal 3D rendering engine at the moment using OpenGL 3.3, GLFW 3.2.1, GLM 0.9.9.3, and Glad.  I'm developing this solely as a hobby.  I am presently working on cleaning up the code in main.cpp by writing writing higher-level wrappers to encompass the basic OpenGL operations. After I will put in a basic geometry framework such that a user might render a cube centered on a point rather than the 12 triangles or 36 points manually. I plan to build the geometry primitives with the GLM library.
